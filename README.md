- This app supports multiple users to chat in different chat rooms, and all data are stored locally in MongoDB to mimic an online database.
- To run the app, run `node server.js` or `nodemon server.js` in the root directory, and type `http://localhost:3000/` in any local browser search bar (Chrome recomended)
- The login page pop up is for testing purpose only without and layout design, and you can use the following credentials to login: 
  - username: `alice`
  - password: `secret`
- Bingo!:smiling_face_with_three_hearts: You are logged in! Feel free to play around with it!
- *Note: Some features are not implemented, such as profile page data storage, but most other features should be functioning  
(Try to open the same chat room in two tabs, and send some messages in one of them. See what happends to the other one!)*
